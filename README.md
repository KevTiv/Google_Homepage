The index file contains a Gmail, Images, google apps(logo), and icon logo at the top of the page. The sign in icon logo redirects to my github (https://github.com/KevTiv).

The page also contains a Google logo, a search bar and search buttons. The search bar and search buttons have a magnifying effect and shadow effect when the cursor hover over them.

The bottom part of the page contain clickable word option (About, Advertising, Business, How to search, Privacy, Terms).

The only active link is found in the sign-in icon top right.
